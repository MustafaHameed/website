## Handover-of-work network

A handover-of-work network can be created with the `resource_map` function. It has the same arguments as the `process_map` function. 

```{r}
patients %>%
	resource_map()
```

## Resource precedence matrix

A more compact representation of hand-over-of-work is given by the `resource_matrix` function, which works the same as the `precedence matrix` functions.

```{r}
patients %>%
	resource_matrix() %>%
	plot()
```
