## Introduction

*	`performance_dashboard`: to look at throughput time, processing time, idle time
*	`activity_dashboard`: to look at activity frequency and presence
*	`rework_dashboard`: to look at rework (selfloops, repetitions)
*	`resource_dashboard`: to look at resource frequency, involvement, specialization
